Animation Practice Answers:

(1) Code line 11 draws the blades of grass ( line(x, height-10, x + random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h))

(2) Line 20 makes the "lawnmower" come by. It comes by when the grass reaches a certain height, the first time when it fills the canvas and the rest of the time it comes by when its above the middle of the canvas.

(3) the H variable represents the height of the blades of grass 

(4) they set the range of value of the hue, saturation and brightness of the colors

(5) The first -10 controls the way the grass is on the ground, changing it to -20 makes it higher off the ground. The height-10 random(h) controls the height of the grass and lets the lawnmower come later after the grass reaches a certain height

Loops and Arrays Answers: 

(1) The first index value is always 0, then it goes 1,2,3,4. The valid index values for an array with 5 elements would be 0,1,2,3,4

(2) A "for loop" is taking the while loop and condenses it. The statement still has to be true to execute it. 
A "while loop" executes the program over and over again if the condition is true. It is used just like an If statement. 

(3) The three parts of a "for loop" in java are called the initalization, the condition and the iteration. 

(4) The code refers to the number of elements as a collection of variables inside the index. 

Older video question answers: 

(1)The point of an object is to keep the varibles together instead of separate things, it basically holds them together as a group. 

(2) A range to use in the map function is col = map(mouseX, 0, 220, 30, 255)


(3) var x = random (1901, 2000)
